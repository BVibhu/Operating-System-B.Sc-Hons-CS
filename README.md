## Lab Practicals

**C/ C++ programs**

1. WRITE A PROGRAM (using _fork()_ and/or _exec()_ commands) where parent and child execute:
      1. same program, same code.
      2. same program, different code.
      3. before terminating, the parent waits for the child to finish its task.

2. WRITE A PROGRAM to report behaviour of Linux kernel including kernel version, CPU type and model. (CPU information)

3. WRITE A PROGRAM to report behaviour of Linux kernel including information on configured memory, amount of free and used memory. (memory information)

4. WRITE A PROGRAM to print file details including owner access permissions, file access time, where file name is given as argument.

5. WRITE A PROGRAM to copy files using system calls.

6. Write program to implement FCFS scheduling algorithm.

7. Write program to implement Round Robin scheduling algorithm.

8. Write program to implement SJF scheduling algorithm.

9. Write program to implement non-preemptive priority based scheduling algorithm.

10. Write program to implement preemptive priority based scheduling algorithm.

11. Write program to implement SRJF scheduling algorithm.

12. Write program to calculate sum of n numbers using _thread_ library.

13. Write a program to implement first-fit, best-fit and worst-fit allocation strategies.
